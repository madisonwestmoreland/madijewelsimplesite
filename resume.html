  <p class="head">About Madison</p>
  <ul>
    <p class="secondsubhead">
      Born and raised in a small coastal town of Swansboro, North Carolina and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020, and has over four years of experience in software engineering and project management. I am passionate about web and app development, and how technology can be used to solve complex problems and make the world better for everyone. I am a lifelong learner, constantly working on improving my skills and learning new technologies. I am adaptable, reliable, attentive, organized, and enthusiastic about my career and the work produced. Recently laid off, I am ready to put 110% of my efforts back into work and ready to prove to anyone how good of a teammate and employee I am. Currently I am residing in Manhattan and looking for hybrid and in-office opportunities after working remotely since 2020 but I am open to being remote as well. In my free time when I am not learning new technologies or keeping up on my skills, I tend to write poetry, read books (I read 76 books in 2023) and take walks with my dog in Central Park. Living in the city has been my dream since I was five years old and I am looking for an opportunity here so that I can stay and keep continuing to follow my dreams.
